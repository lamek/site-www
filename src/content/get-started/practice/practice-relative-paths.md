# Practice: Relative Paths

This page provides a quick overview and interactive exercises to help you understand the foundational concept of **Relative Paths** in Dart. This is particularly useful if you're new to programming.

## What is Relative Paths?

Imagine your computer's files and folders are organized like a house. A *relative path* is like giving directions to a specific room starting from where you currently are. Instead of giving the full address of the house (which would be an *absolute path*), you say "go down the hall and turn left."

Understanding relative paths is crucial for beginners to grasp how files and directories are organized within a project. This knowledge is vital for referencing files correctly, especially when dealing with local packages or assets. It helps them visualize the project's file structure and avoid errors related to file locations. This chapter uses the `path` dependency and `../command_runner`. Think of `../` as "go up one level" in your directory structure. The `path` package offers tools to help you manipulate and construct file paths in a way that's safe and reliable across different operating systems.

## Examples and Practice

Try out the examples below directly in DartPad. Experiment by changing the code and observing the output!

### Example 1: Navigate Up a Directory

This example shows how to use the `path` package to navigate one directory level up using a relative path. We'll use `../` to simulate going back to the parent directory.

```dartpad:run-dart
import 'package:path/path.dart' as p;

void main() {
  // Start in a "subdirectory"
  String currentPath = 'my_project/lib/src';

  // Navigate up one level using '..'
  String parentPath = p.normalize(p.join(currentPath, '..'));

  // Print the resulting path
  print('Current path: $currentPath');
  print('Parent path: $parentPath');
}
```

By using `../`, we effectively moved from `my_project/lib/src` to `my_project/lib`. How would you navigate two levels up?

### Example 2: Constructing a Relative Path

This example demonstrates how to build a relative path to a file in a different part of your project, starting from a known location. This showcases how to create paths that depend on your starting point.

```dartpad:run-dart
import 'package:path/path.dart' as p;

void main() {
  // Starting point:  A directory within your project
  String assetsDirectory = 'my_project/assets';

  // Target:  A file located in a different directory
  String imageFile = 'images/logo.png';

  // Construct the full relative path to the image
  String fullPath = p.join(assetsDirectory, imageFile);

  // Print the result
  print('Full path to image: $fullPath');
}
```

Notice how `p.join` combines the directory and file to create the complete relative path. What happens if the `imageFile` path also includes `../`?

## Challenge (Optional)
Can you modify the first example to navigate *two* levels up in the directory structure?

Code snippet

```dart
import 'package:path/path.dart' as p;

void main() {
  // Start in a "subdirectory"
  String currentPath = 'my_project/lib/src/utils';

  // Navigate up TWO levels using '..'
  // Your code here!

  // Print the resulting path
  // print('Parent path: $parentPath');
}
```
